# Transfer-entropy-spectrum-in-the-Fourier-domain
This is the algorithm for calculating the transfer entropy spectrum in the Fourier-domain, which is a novel generalization of transfer entropy. There are **4 folders** in our open-source codes.

**On 2021.10.11**, we will let the MATLAB implementation of our algorithm be open source. One can learn about this implementation according to our paper.
You can find this version in the **Initial-MATLAB-version folder**. This is the algorithm implemented in our paper entitled **"Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum"**. You can find the pre-print of this paper via **[Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042040)**.

**Coming soon**, we will release the Python version of our algorithm. You can find this version in the **Initial-Pyton-version folder**. This version is equivalent to the
the version in the **Initial-MATLAB-version branch** and designed for Python users. This is the algorithm implemented in our paper entitled **"Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum"**. You can find the pre-print of this paper via **[Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042040)**.

Below, we introduce the details of the **Initial-MATLAB-version folder**. Among these files, "MainFunctionforFDTES.m" 
is the main function to run. "SymbolizationFunction.m", "SearchHistory.m", "FourierDomainTransferEntropySpectrum.m", "SignificanceTestFunction.m" 
are ancillary functions to realize different steps of our approach. 

Please note that there is a file **"permutationTest.m"** uploaded as a ancillary function of "SignificanceTestFunction.m". It is not our original work, 
and we upload it only for the convenience of other users. **The credits of this code should belong to Laurens R Krol** via https://github.com/lrkrol/permutationTest. 
**When you use our algorithm, please cite Laurens R Krol's work as well**.

The function is given in following forms:
```
[TransferEntropyM,XTSymbolMatrix,XFSymbolMatrix,YTSymbolMatrix,YFSymbolMatrix,f,varargout]=MainFunctionforFDTES(X,Y,TOrder,FOrder,TLag,Type,varargin)
```
To use our code (both MATLAB and Python version), one may consider following tips:

<big>**Input:**</big>

**(1)** X is a n*1 time series vector. It can not contain Inf and NaN so you
have to pre-process it;

**(2)** Y is a n*1 time series vector. It can not contain Inf and NaN so you
have to pre-process it;

**(3)** TOrder is \lambda in the paper. It determines the coarse-graining on
time-line during the symbolization; It should be a positive number and 
never be larger than the length of time series.

**(4)** FOrder is \theta in the paper. It determines the coarse-graining on
frequency-line during the symbolization; It should be a positive number  
and never be larger than the length of frequency bands.

**(5)** TLag is \beta in the paper. It determines the length historical 
information added in transfer entropy calculation;

**(6)** Type is used to determine if you want to set all negative TEs in the
TransferEntropyM as 0. If Type=1, then all negative TEs become 0. If
Type=0, then we keep the raw data and you can still obtain negative TEs.

**(7)** varargin contains the information of statistic significance test. If
you do not want the statistic significance test, just do not enter
varargin. If varargin is not empty, it is expected to contain two inputs
so that NumofSurrogates=varargin{1} and ShiftInterval=varargin{2}. NumofSurrogates 
determines how many surrogates you are going to generate during the 
statistic significance test. Please note that surrogate generation and 
statistic significance test is computationally costly. For instance, 
NumofSurrogates=k means that k surrogates are generated, k times of 
Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum calculations are implemented, 
and a permutation test is carried out. ShiftInterval should be a vector 
[p,q], where p is the minimum time shift and q is the maximum time shift. 

<big>**Output:**</big>

**(1)** TransferEntropyM is the Fourier-domain transfer entropy spectrum
T(X,Y,t,\omega). If you calculate sum(TransferEntropyM), you obtain
T(X,Y,t); If you calculate sum(TransferEntropyM,2), you obtain
T(X,Y,\omega); If you calculate sum(sum(TransferEntropyM)), you obtain
T(X,Y); 

**(2)** XTSymbolMatrix is the symbolization result of X along the time line,
namely \Lambda_{\mathsf{X}}\left(t,\omega\right) in the paper.

**(3)** XFSymbolMatrix is the symbolization result of X along the frequency 
line, namely \Theta_{\mathsf{X}}\left(t,\omega\right) in the paper.

**(4)** YTSymbolMatrix is the symbolization result of Y along the time line,
namely \Theta_{\mathsf{Y}}\left(t,\omega\right) in the paper.

**(5)** YFSymbolMatrix is the symbolization result of Y along the frequency 
line, namely \Theta_{\mathsf{Y}}\left(t,\omega\right) in the paper.

**(6)** f is the frequency band obtained from wavelet transfrom. Please note
that you are not required to specify a sampling frequency so f is
returned as number of cycles per sample. f is \omega in the paper.

**(7)** If you want to do statistic significance test and you do provide the
varargin, then you can ask for varargout. varargout{1}=P denotes the p
value of significance test. varargout{2}=Effectsize denotes the effect 
size. varargout{3}=TESample denotes the set of T(X,Y,\omega). varargout{4}
denotes the the set of T(X',Y,\omega) generated by surrogates.

(2) If you do not want the statistic significance test:
